## PopulatedRedemption interface

A redemption transaction that has been prepared for sending.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface PopulatedRedemption<P = unknown, S = unknown, R = unknown> extends PopulatedBeraBorrowTransaction<P, SentBeraBorrowTransaction<S, BeraBorrowReceipt<R, RedemptionDetails>>> 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [PopulatedBeraBorrowTransaction](./lib-base.populatedberaborrowtransaction.md)<!-- -->&lt;P, [SentBeraBorrowTransaction](./lib-base.sentberaborrowtransaction.md)<!-- -->&lt;S, [BeraBorrowReceipt](./lib-base.beraborrowreceipt.md)<!-- -->&lt;R, [RedemptionDetails](./lib-base.redemptiondetails.md)<!-- -->&gt;&gt;&gt;

## Remarks

The BeraBorrow protocol fulfills redemptions by repaying the debt of Troves in ascending order of their collateralization ratio, and taking a portion of their collateral in exchange. Due to the [minimum debt](./lib-base.nect_minimum_debt.md) requirement that Troves must fulfill, some NECT amounts are not possible to redeem exactly.

When [redeemNECT()](./lib-base.populatableberaborrow.redeemnect.md) is called with an amount that can't be fully redeemed, the amount will be truncated (see the `redeemableNECTAmount` property). When this happens, the redeemer can either redeem the truncated amount by sending the transaction unchanged, or prepare a new transaction by [increasing the amount](./lib-base.populatedredemption.increaseamountbyminimumnetdebt.md) to the next lowest possible value, which is the sum of the truncated amount and [NECT\_MINIMUM\_NET\_DEBT](./lib-base.nect_minimum_net_debt.md)<!-- -->.
